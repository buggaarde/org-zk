* org-zk -- Zettelkasten in org-mode
  
Provides a zettelkasten workflow similar to the experience of LÃ¼hmann.

** The basics
   
A note is an org-mode file with the following structure
#+begin_src org
  ,#+title: Your note title here
  ,#+startup: showall
  ,** Note

  ,** References

  ,** Sources

#+end_src

The actual contents of the note goes into the ~Note~ section;
any reference to other notes are listed in the ~References~ section,
and external sources are listed in the ~Sources~ section.
References and sources are normal org-mode links,
and can be listed inline in the note itself --
but are also automatically listed in their respective sections as well,
when the provided ~org-zk~ functions are used to insert links.

** Linking notes

Links between notes are always bi-directional,
and by adding a link from one note to another, a link from the former will be added automatically to the References section of the former.

** Unique note identifiers

The file itself will be named after the datetime at creation,
and will therefore be unique.
To open a note by it's title, instead of ~find-file~ use ~org-zk-open-note~,
which will list all notes by their ~#+title~ attribute.

| ~org-zk-create-empty-note-and-open~ | ~C-c z n~         | Create and open a new empty note, and place cursor after the ~#+title:~ attribute.                                                                                                                 |
